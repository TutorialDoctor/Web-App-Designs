## The Generalized Process

1. Think of an idea for an app.
2. Make a quick sketch piece of paper.
3. Use the [Sketch App](https://www.sketchapp.com) or [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/) to mock a design of the paper sketch.
4. Structure the basic HTML
5. Style the HTML with CSS (I used [Bootstrap]())
